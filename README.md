# Threds App Sentiment

With what's currently going on with Twitter and Meta launching its own version of it, Threads, I thought it would be interesting to see the publics overall sentiment of the new app. The reviews are coming from both the App store & Google Play

At the time of downloading the dataset, only reviews from July, 6, 2023 to July 25, 2023 were uploaded. Given that there are over 32,000 rows, I believe it will give plenty to work with to see how people feel overall about Meta's latest launch.

The findings show both what were a given as well as some mildly amusing results.

Main Objectives:

- What were the top 10 popular words across all reviews?
- Which applications had the highest 5 star reviews and the lowest?
- Across both apps, which apps had the most reviews per date?

Tools used:

SQL - for cleaning and data analyzation

Tableau - for data visualization

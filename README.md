# threads_app_sentiment

With what's currently going on with Twitter and Meta launching its own version of it, Threads, I thought it would be interesting to see the publics overall sentiment of the new app.

At the time of downloading the dataset, only reviews from July, 6, 2023 to July 25, 2023 were uploaded. Given that there are over 32,000 rows, I believe it will give plenty to work with to see how people feel overall about Meta's latest launch.

The findings show both what were a given as well as some mildly amusing results.

Tools used:
SQL - for cleaning and data analyzation
Tableau - for data visualization

The dataset is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saloni1712/threads-an-instagram-app-reviews
